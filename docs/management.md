# Remote Firmata Management
The methods in this section allow your application to 
perform some Firmata management functions remotely.

## keep_alive

For Arduino's utilizing an ATmega328P processor, this
exclusive FirmataExpress feature will reset the Arduino
if serial communication is lost between pymata-express and the Arduino.

```python
 async def keep_alive(self, period=1, margin=0.3)

    This is a FirmataExpress feature.

    Periodically send a keep alive message to the Arduino.

    If the Arduino does not received a keep alive, the Arduino will physically reset itself.

    Frequency of keep alive transmission is calculated as follows: 
        keep_alive_sent = period - margin

    :param period: Time period between keepalives.
                   Range is 0-10 seconds. 
                0 disables the keepalive mechanism.

    :param margin: Safety margin to assure keepalives are 
                   sent before period expires. Range is 0.1 to 0.9
```

**Example:**

[keep_alive.py](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/blob/master/examples/keep_alive.py)

**Notes:**

When keep_alive is called, it spawns and runs in its own thread.

## send_reset

```python
 async def send_reset(self)

    Send a Sysex reset command to the arduino
```

**Examples:**

All examples call shutdown, which in turn calls send_reset.

**Notes:**

This command will reset several Firmata internal data structures. 

* It resets its internal i2c flags to indicate there are no i2c devices present.
* Digital reporting is turned off.
* It resets any analog pin that was set to a digital mode back to analog mode.
* If a pin was configured for tone, the tone is turned off.
* It clears all servo entries from its servo map.
* It sets the number of active sonar devices to zero.

The shutdown method calls *send_reset*.

## shutdown

```python
  async def shutdown(self)

    This method attempts an orderly shutdown. 
    If any exceptions are thrown, they are ignored.
```
**Examples:**

All the examples call shutdown.
