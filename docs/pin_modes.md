# Introduction
An Arduino pin can be configured to operate in one of several modes.
The modes available to any given pin is dependent upon pin type.

For example, 
a digital pin may be configured for input, output, and for some digital pins, PWM output operation.

Analog input pins
are even more flexible.
They may be configured for analog input, digital input, or digital output operation.

PymataExpress requires that before using a pin, its mode must be explicitly set. This is accomplished using one of
the pymata-express mode setting methods.

In this section, the methods to set pin modes are presented. For each API method, a link to an example is
provided. 

## ANALOG PIN MODE

### set_pin_mode_analog_input

```python
 async def set_pin_mode_analog_input(self, pin_number, callback=None, differential=1)

    Set a pin as an analog input.

    :param pin_number: arduino pin number

    :param callback: async callback function

    :param differential: This value needs to be met for a callback to be invoked.

    callback returns a data list:

    [pin_type, pin_number, pin_value, raw_time_stamp]

    The pin_type for analog input pins = 2

```
**Examples:**

1. [analog_input_with_time_stamps.py](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/blob/master/examples/analog_input_with_time_stamps.py)
2. [analog_input_with_time_stamps_oo.py](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/blob/master/examples/analog_input_with_time_stamps_oo.py)

**Notes:** 

1. When an analog input message is received from Firmata, the current reported
data value is compared with that of the previously reported value. If the difference, either positive or negative,
is greater than the differential parameter, then the callback is invoked. This is useful when you have a "noisy"
input that may constantly fluctuate by a small value, and you wish to ignore the noise.
2. Pymata-express refers to analog pins using the numeric portion of the pin number only. 
For example, pin A3 is referred to as pin 3.
3. Data reporting via callbacks for this pin begins immediately after this method is called. 



## DIGITAL PIN MODES

### set_pin_mode_digital_input
```python
 async def set_pin_mode_digital_input(self, pin_number, callback=None)

    Set a pin as a digital input.

    :param pin_number: arduino pin number

    :param callback: async callback function

    callback returns a data list:

    [pin_type, pin_number, pin_value, raw_time_stamp]

    The pin_type for digital input pins = 0
```

**Examples:** 

1. [digital_input.py](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/blob/master/examples/digital_input.py)
2. [digital_input_debounce.py](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/blob/master/examples/digital_input_debounce.py)

**Notes:** 

Data reporting via callbacks for this pin begins immediately after this method is called. 


### set_pin_mode_digital_input_pullup

```python
 async def set_pin_mode_digital_input_pullup(self, pin_number, callback=None)

    Set a pin as a digital input with pullup enabled.

    :param pin_number: arduino pin number

    :param callback: async callback function

    callback returns a data list:

    [pin_type, pin_number, pin_value, raw_time_stamp]

    The pin_type for digital input pins with pullups enabled = 11
```
**Example:** 

1. [digital_input_pullup.py](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/blob/master/examples/digital_input_pullup.py) 

**Notes:** 

Data reporting via callbacks for this pin begins immediately after this method is called. 

### set_pin_mode_digital_output
```python
 async def set_pin_mode_digital_output(self, pin_number)

    Set a pin as a digital output pin.

    :param pin_number: arduino pin number


```
**Examples:** 

1. [digital_output.py](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/blob/master/examples/digital_output.py)
2. [digital_pin_output.py](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/blob/master/examples/digital_pin_output.py)


### set_pin_mode_pwm
```python
 async def set_pin_mode_pwm(self, pin_number)

    This is an alias for set_pin_mode_pwm_output.

    Set a pin as a pwm (analog output) pin.

    :param pin_number:arduino pin number
```

**Example:**
1. [pwm_analog_output.py](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-express/blob/master/examples/pwm_analog_output.py)

**Notes:** 

Only specific digital pins support PWM mode. Check with the Arduino documentation
to determine which pins support PWM for your board.

### set_pin_mode_pwm_output

```python
 async def set_pin_mode_pwm_output(self, pin_number)

    Set a pin as a pwm (analog output) pin.

    :param pin_number:arduino pin number
```
